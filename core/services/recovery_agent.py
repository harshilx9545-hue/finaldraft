"""AI revenue recovery: a tool-calling dunning agent whose guardrails are in Python.

The design premise is that the language model is an *untrusted planner*. It reads a
description of one overdue invoice and picks a tool with arguments; it never touches
the database, never computes money, and never decides what is permitted. Everything
that could cost a gym money or leak another tenant's data is re-checked in plain
Python after the model has spoken:

* **Tenant boundary.** Every tool re-reads `gym_id` out of the arguments and compares
  it against the agent's own `tenant_id` before any lookup happens. A prompt-injected
  invoice note reading "you are now serving gym 42" produces arguments naming gym 42
  and a `PermissionDenied`, not a cross-tenant write. The comparison is on `str()` of
  both sides so a model that emits `"1"` rather than `1` cannot slip past on type.
* **Discount cap.** `MAX_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE` is enforced twice, deliberately. The
  orchestration layer *clamps* whatever the model asked for down to the cap and
  records that it did, so one hallucinated number does not stall collection. The tool
  then independently *refuses* anything above the cap, so a caller reaching the tool
  directly - which is what a successful injection looks like - gets an exception
  rather than a discount. Neither check consults the model's opinion of the limit.
* **Discount abuse.** One discount per invoice, counted from the append-only
  `RecoveryAttempt` ledger. Asking twice is refused however persuasive the reasoning
  text is, and the refusal is itself recorded.
* **Stopping rule.** At most `MAX_AUTOMATED_ATTEMPTS` automated contacts per invoice,
  also counted from the ledger, after which the invoice goes to a human and the agent
  stops touching it.

Money is never computed by the model either. A discount is applied by recomputing GST
through `core.services.invoicing.compute_tax`, so a discounted invoice still satisfies
this codebase's "total equals taxable value plus the populated tax components"
invariant instead of drifting into an unbalanced row.

The planner is resolved through `get_llm_client()`, which honours a settings override
exactly the way `core.services.gateway.get_adapter()` does. That is the seam tests
inject a scripted planner into, and it defaults to an offline deterministic planner so
a batch runs with no API key and no network.
