"""Run the AI revenue recovery batch and print a measured report.

    python manage.py run_recovery_batch --synthetic-data
    python manage.py run_recovery_batch --gym iron-pit-7 --live
    python manage.py run_recovery_batch --synthetic-data --rounds 4

`--synthetic-data` seeds a throwaway gym with 50 overdue member invoices spread across
all four escalation tiers, runs the whole batch through the agent, and prints what was
recovered, what is still pending, what was stopped, and a per-invoice audit line for
every decision including the ones the guardrails refused.

`--rounds N` runs the batch N times against the same data. That is how the stopping rule
becomes visible: the same invoice is contacted at most three times, and from the fourth
round on it reports `stopped_attempt_limit` instead of a fourth reminder.

The formatting helpers are module-level and importable, so the conformance tests can
assert on the report text without capturing stdout.
