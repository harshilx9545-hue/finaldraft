# Implementation Plan: gym-saas-core

## Overview

Phase 1 grows the existing Django project in place: one project package (`gymapp`), one app (`core`).
The order below is bottom-up so nothing depends on code that does not exist yet: dependencies and the
`Config_Loader` first, then pure services (money, slugs, validators), then the full model layer, then the
destructive migration-baseline rebuild, then the tenant isolation and authorization layer, then auth,
then the money services, then the gateway and webhook, then serializers/views/URL wiring, and finally the
two conformance management commands that act as deployment gates.

Language: Python 3 / Django, as specified in the design. Tests use `pytest` + `pytest-django` +
`hypothesis`, with a `FakeRazorpayAdapter` so no property test touches the network.

Property test tasks reference the 40 correctness properties in `design.md` by number. Each property is
implemented by exactly one property-based test in its own module, at `@settings(max_examples=100)` or 500
for the pure functions (Properties 7, 18, 19, 27, 28).

## Current status

**All tasks complete.**

| Backend | Result |
| --- | --- |
| SQLite (default) | 323 passed, 3 skipped, 4 deselected |
| PostgreSQL 16 | 326 passed, **0 skipped**, 4 deselected |
| SQLite under `-n auto` | 323 passed, 3 skipped |

The 3 SQLite skips are the concurrency clauses, which run and pass on PostgreSQL — see
below. The 4 deselected are the Razorpay sandbox tests, excluded by `pytest.ini`.

All 40 design properties now have exactly one property-based test each. Deployment
gates: `manage.py check`, `check --deploy` against a production-shaped environment,
`check_tenant_scoping`, `check_api_surface` and `makemigrations --check --dry-run` all
pass, and `migrate` applies cleanly to an empty database from a single baseline.

### How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q                       # gateway integration tests are excluded by pytest.ini
pytest -q -m integration        # opt in to the Razorpay sandbox tests
python manage.py check_tenant_scoping
python manage.py check_api_surface
```

A `.env` is required — copy `.env.example` and set at least `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`.
`gymapp/config.validate()` runs as the last statement of `settings.py`, so a missing
key raises `ImproperlyConfigured` at import rather than failing later.

Under pytest, `PASSWORD_HASHERS` drops to MD5 (guarded by `"pytest" in sys.modules`
**and** `DEBUG`). That is a test-speed measure only; the `DEBUG` conjunct is the
fail-safe so a misfire on a production process cannot weaken password storage.

### The three PostgreSQL-only tests

- `test_property_20_invoice_numbering.py::test_concurrent_issues_produce_no_duplicates`
- `test_property_23_webhook_idempotency.py::test_concurrent_deliveries_of_one_event_settle_once`
- `test_property_32_concurrent_members.py::test_concurrent_attempts_yield_exactly_min_n_k`

These skip unless the test database is PostgreSQL, which is the design's own position:
SQLite takes a database-level lock rather than a row-level one, so `select_for_update()`
cannot be shown to do anything there and a passing test would prove nothing. Each module
also carries a sequential variant that runs on SQLite and covers the arithmetic
(`min(N, K)`, gapless numbering, one terminal Payment per event).

All three have been executed and pass against PostgreSQL 16:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pw@localhost:5432/gymapp pytest -q
# 326 passed, 4 deselected  (no skips)
```

### Implementation defects found and fixed while writing the remaining tests

| Area | Defect | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core/scoping.py` | `TenantScopedQuerysetMixin` called `super().get_queryset()`, which does not exist on a plain `APIView`. `POST /api/invoices/{id}/pay` and `GET /api/payments/{id}/receipt` both raised `AttributeError` and returned 500 — the whole payment path was unreachable. Added `get_base_queryset()`. | 17.1, 19.9 |
| `core/models.py` | Soft-deleting a Payment, Invoice or Membership wrote no `AuditRecord`. Added an opt-in audit on the soft-delete/restore path. | 22.1 |
| `core/views/profiles.py` | `MeView` carried no write gate, so a lapsed Gym and an inactive Member could still `PATCH /api/me`. Added `RoleAllowed`, `SubscriptionWriteGate`, `ActiveMemberGate`. | 20.8, 21.5 |
| `core/views/profiles.py` | Member creation answered 403 rather than the mandated 402 when the Gym had no live subscription, because `SubscriptionWriteGate` pre-empted `RequiresSubscription`. Reordered. | 5.7 |
| `core/serializers.py` | A duplicate MembershipPlan name reached the `UniqueConstraint(Lower("name"))` index and surfaced as a 500; DRF cannot derive a validator from a constraint containing an expression. Added `validate_name`. | 2.4 |
| `core/serializers.py` | A duplicate phone on a trainer or member invite surfaced as a 500. Added `validate_phone` to both invite serializers. | 10.3 |
| `core/models.py` | `unique_together` does not constrain rows where `gym` is NULL, so the platform-wide `StrengthStandard` key was not actually unique and the shared-row lookup could return two contradictory rows. Added a partial `UniqueConstraint`. | 2.5, 2.2 |
| `core/views/profiles.py` | Trainer and member lists paginated an unordered queryset, which can repeat or drop a row between pages. Added explicit ordering. | — |
| `tools/rebuild_migration_baseline.py` | `rebuild()` swept the module-level `MIGRATIONS_DIR` rather than the baseline's own directory, so a caller that redirected `BASELINE` still deleted the real migrations. Now derived from `BASELINE.parent`. | 9.2 |

### Repository note

Commit `54c1222` ("merge remote and update backend fixes") was made with unresolved
conflicts still in the tree, so `<<<<<<<` markers were committed into 15 files and
`settings.py` would not import. That is already fixed on `main`.
`tools/resolve_committed_conflicts.py` records the resolution rule and can re-check the
tree if it happens again — run it with `--check` first.

If you see a branch named `fix/resolve-merge-conflicts-and-spec-status` on the remote,
do not merge it. It fixes the same problem but is based on the broken `54c1222`, and
`main` already carries an equivalent fix plus `core/authentication.py` and
`core/migrations/0002_alter_memberprofile_options.py`, which that branch would revert.
It can be deleted.

Migration `0002_alter_memberprofile_options.py` no longer exists. Task 5.2 regenerated
the baseline, and requirement 9.1 asks for a *single* replacement migration, so the
rebuild script now sweeps every generated migration before regenerating. The tree holds
exactly `core/migrations/0001_initial.py` plus the package marker, and
`makemigrations --check --dry-run` reports nothing pending.

## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for a faster MVP; the core implementation tasks are not optional.
- Task 5 is destructive by design: it deletes `db.sqlite3` and the existing `core/migrations/0001_initial.py`. There is no production data to preserve, per the fixed decision in the requirements, but the deletion is irreversible for any local data currently in that database.
- Property tests are placed immediately after the code they validate so failures surface early. Each of the 40 design properties has exactly one test module.
- Properties 16, 25, 30, 31 are stateful (`RuleBasedStateMachine` with `@invariant()`); Properties 20, 32 need a PostgreSQL test database because SQLite locking is too coarse to prove the concurrency criteria.
- Configuration, hardening, and surface criteria are covered by the single-execution checks in task 16.5 rather than by property tests, since their behaviour does not vary with input.
